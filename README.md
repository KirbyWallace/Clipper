# Clipper
Just for LOLs.

Clipper was the first **compiled** language that I ever worked in, back in the 80s.  

Here's the source for a popular "shareware" function library I wrote back then.  

Many of these functions, written decades ago, I have translated into numerous other languages as the years have gone by.

Provided here just for historical antiquity.  Even though it is old, you can still see patterns that I still use to this very day.
